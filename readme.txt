A short description of the project's name and what it does: The project is called 112 fireboy watergirl. It is adapted from popular game fireboy watergirl where there are two main characters- a boy made of fire and a girl made from water and you need to help them escape from a dungeon. Each character can move up,down,left,right,up left,up right,down left and downright. For up left and up right if it is possible to move 1 up and 1 left/right then you will else you will move 2 up and 1 left/right. Gravity is implemented so each character will fall till they reach a wall if the character isn't already standing on one. Similar to the game, fire and water can not mix so fireboy can not touch water or watergirl can not touch fire without losing the game. Once both fireboy and watergirl reach their respective doors then you have won the game. The board is randomly generated and a depth first search algorithm is used to ensure that the randomly generated board is winnable for both fireboy and watergirl. There is also an option to play with AI controlled fire boy or AI controlled watergirl which uses a similar depth first search algorithm to find the path for which character is AI controlled to reach their respective door.
